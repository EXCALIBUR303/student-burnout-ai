    "sleep":         "Fatigue is one of the earliest burnout signals. Try a fixed wind-down time tonight — even 30 minutes earlier than usual can reset your sleep rhythm. Avoid caffeine after 2 pm and keep your room below 19 C.",
    "tired":         "Fatigue often signals your body needs real recovery, not just a short break. Try a 20-minute nap before 3 pm. Check whether you're drinking enough water — dehydration mimics exhaustion.",
    "insomnia":      "Insomnia during exam periods is very common — cortisol spikes block melatonin. Try 4-7-8 breathing as you lie down: inhale 4s, hold 7s, exhale 8s. Do 4 cycles.",
    "focus":         "Try the 45-15 rule: 45 minutes of deep work, then 15 minutes fully off-screen. Remove your phone from the room. Your brain needs actual downtime — not just a different screen.",
    "concentrate":   "Concentration improves with a consistent environment. Use the same desk, the same time each day. Brown noise or lo-fi music (no lyrics) keeps background distraction low without engaging your language centres.",
    "distract":      "Every notification interrupts focus for 23 minutes on average. Turn your phone face-down in another room for your study blocks. Use website blockers for the first 45 minutes of each session.",
    "overwhelm":     "When everything feels like too much, pick ONE task for the next 25 minutes. Write the others down so your brain stops holding them. You don't have to solve everything today.",
    "stress":        "Stress is a signal, not a verdict. Try box breathing right now: inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s, hold 4s. Do 4 cycles. Then write down the one stressor you actually control today.",
    "pressure":      "Academic pressure is real. Break whatever is looming into the smallest possible next action — not a goal, a physical action. Start with that. Momentum beats motivation every time.",
    "anxious":       "Anxiety often comes from focusing on things outside your control. Try 5-4-3-2-1 grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste. Brings you back to now.",
    "anxiety":       "Anxiety often comes from focusing on things outside your control. Try 5-4-3-2-1 grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste. Brings you back to now.",
    "panic":         "When panic hits: drop your shoulders, unclench your jaw, slow your exhale to double the inhale (breathe in 4s, out 8s). Your nervous system has a brake pedal — the long exhale activates it.",
    "exam":          "Exam pressure is real. Shorter, frequent sessions beat marathon cramming: 3x45 min beats one 3-hour block. Review material within 24 hours of first learning it — that's when memory consolidation happens.",
    "assignment":    "Break the assignment into a list of small, concrete actions. Start with the easiest item to build momentum, then tackle the hardest while your energy is up. Aim for 'good enough to submit' before 'perfect'.",
    "deadline":      "Deadline stress narrows thinking. Write down what actually needs to be done vs what you're worrying about — often the real list is much smaller. Work backward from the deadline: what needs to be done today?",
    "grade":         "Grades feel final but rarely are. Talk to your lecturer if you're struggling — most are more approachable than students expect. One grade doesn't define your trajectory.",
    "fail":          "Failing a paper or assessment is painful but rarely catastrophic. Take a breath, look at your options (resit, resubmit, extension), and act on one of them. Action reduces the anxiety more than thinking does.",
    "burnout":       "Burnout needs real rest, not just a short break. Schedule at least one full day this week with zero academic work. Recovery is not laziness — you can't pour from an empty cup.",
    "exhausted":     "Exhaustion this deep is your body's emergency signal. The immediate priority is sleep, then food, then one manageable task. Nothing else. Give yourself permission to recover.",
    "motivation":    "Low motivation is usually depleted energy, not laziness. Sleep, regular meals, and 10 minutes outside are the fastest rebuilders. Start with the smallest possible first step — even 2 minutes of work.",
    "procrastinat":  "Procrastination is avoidance, usually of discomfort (not the task itself). The 2-minute rule: commit to just 2 minutes on the task. Most people keep going past 2 minutes once started.",
    "lazy":          "Low motivation is usually a sign of depleted energy or unclear next steps — not laziness. Identify the single smallest first action on your task and just do that one thing.",
    "lonely":        "Isolation amplifies every stressor. You don't need big plans — even a 10-minute call with someone you trust measurably shifts your nervous system state.",
    "alone":         "Social connection is a direct stress buffer. Even a voice note to a friend counts. Isolation feels safe when overwhelmed but actually makes the stress compound.",
    "isolated":      "Withdrawal is one of burnout's traps — it removes the social buffering that prevents stress from compounding. Reach out to one person today, even briefly.",
    "sad":           "Low mood during a stressful period is very common and usually temporary. Try logging 3 small things that went okay today — it gently shifts your brain's attentional bias. If it persists, please talk to a counsellor.",
    "depress":       "It's okay to not be okay. What you're feeling is real. Please consider talking to your university counsellor or a trusted person — you don't have to carry this alone, and support is available.",
    "hopeless":      "When things feel hopeless, that's usually a sign of severe depletion — not the truth about your situation. Please reach out to someone you trust, or contact your university's student support service today.",
    "food":          "Skipping meals is a hidden stressor — blood sugar crashes spike cortisol and impair focus. Even a small snack every 4 hours keeps your brain running steadily.",
    "eating":        "Nutrition directly affects mood and concentration. Irregular eating creates blood sugar swings that amplify anxiety. Even simple, easy food eaten consistently makes a measurable difference.",
    "social media":  "Social media use above 2 hours/day is correlated with increased anxiety in students. Try app timers: 30-minute daily limits. Check it at fixed times rather than whenever you feel like it.",
    "phone":         "Every phone check interrupts focus for up to 23 minutes. Put it face-down or in another room during study blocks. You'll get the same information later — with much better focus now.",
